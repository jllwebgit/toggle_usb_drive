\# USB Drive Enable/Disable Tool



This tool allows you to \*\*enable or disable USB drives\*\* on your system.



\## Purpose

\- Mainly intended for external hard drives.  

\- Disabling a USB drive forces the hard disk to \*\*spin down\*\*, which helps reduce \*\*heat generation\*\* and power consumption.  



\## Behavior

\- If the drive is disabled while it is in use, it will remain \*\*accessible until the PC is restarted\*\*.  

\- After a reboot, the USB device will be completely disabled.  

\- For safety, please \*\*check the usage status\*\* and disable the drive only when it is not actively in use.  



\## Use Cases

\- Reduce unnecessary heat from idle external hard drives.  

\- Save energy by spinning down drives when not needed.
